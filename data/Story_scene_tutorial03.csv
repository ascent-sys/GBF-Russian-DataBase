English,scene_tutorial03,synopsis,,"Concluding that they'll be captured if they linger any longer, [Игрок] and the new-found crew jump on a small airship and leave behind the island of Zinkenstill. Together with the enigmatic Lyria, [Игрок] begins a journey to the end of the sky.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"Ngh... If we stay here, it's only a matter of time before they back us into a corner.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"We've no choice but to leave the island! Come! I prepared a small ship ahead of time for our escape!",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Vyrn,"Looks like your dream of skyfaring's coming true faster than we thought, [Игрок]! Better brace yourself!",
English,scene_tutorial03,sel1_txt,,I'm ready for anything!,
English,scene_tutorial03,sel2_txt,,Shouldn't you brace yourself, Vyrn?,
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Vyrn,"Ha ha! You sure know how to roll with the punches. Just like your dad!",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Vyrn,"Ha ha! Who do you think you're talkin' to?",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Vyrn,"If anyone here was born to fly, it's me!",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Lyria,"Hey, Katalina. Vyrn and [Игрок] seem like best friends, don't you think?",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"They do indeed.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"It's strange, but... I can't help but feel a sense of calm when I see Vyrn flying there so innocently.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Lyria,"You've always liked cute little animals, right, Katalina?",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"Yes... But this is no time to daydream!",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"Let's go. The ship's this way!",
English,scene_tutorial03,sel1_txt,,Got it!,
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Vyrn,"Our time to shine's arrived at last, [Игрок]!",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Lyria,"I guess it's a new beginning for us both then, [Игрок]!",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,,"The gang boards a small imperial airship and sets sail from [Игрок]'s secluded island home.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,,"Hurtling towards a seemingly boundless sea of golden clouds, they're overcome not with fear, but with a sense of hope.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Vyrn,"The sky! We're flying through the sky!",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Vyrn,"Hey, Katalina! Where are we headed in this thing?",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"Good question... You're headed for the end of the sky, right, [Игрок]?",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"That must mean Estalucia, the legendary island where the Astrals are said to live. Making it there won't be easy.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Vyrn,"Oh really! Tell us somethin' we <span class='scene-font-italic'>don't</span> know! Right, [Игрок]?",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"I see... Then our first order of business is to cross the Grim Basin, which divides the skydoms.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"That fits my plan. We can't stay here in Phantagrande Skydom after all. Not while it's under the influence of the Empire.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Lyria,"But the sky's so vast... Are they really going to come after us?",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"I'm certain they will... But you needn't worry. The sky is boundless!",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"Once we're outside Phantagrande, the Empire shouldn't be able to chase us.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Vyrn,"Sounds like we're in for the long haul!",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"Indeed. To the end of the sky... We may be playing things by ear, but I can't help but feel a little excited.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"First things first. We need to get our supplies in order.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"If we head to a large town, there should be a general store that caters to airship crews.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Katalina,"Our closest options are Port Breeze and the Valtz Duchy... There's bound to be someone there who can provide what we need.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Lyria,"I can't believe it... I'm on a journey to a new world!",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Lyria,"With Katalina, Vyrn, [Игрок], and maybe even more people we'll meet along the way.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Vyrn,"We'll probably make plenty of new friends! I can't wait to see who we run into!",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,Vyrn,"So let's get this adventure to the end of the sky started, [Игрок]!",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,,"[Игрок]'s soul now one with Lyria's, the time has come to bid farewell to home.",
English,scene_tutorial03,detail,,"As though sent by [Игрок]'s father from the other side of the infinite sky, a gentle blue breeze blows across the young voyager's hair.",
