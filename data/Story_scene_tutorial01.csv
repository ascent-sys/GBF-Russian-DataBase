English,scene_tutorial01,detail,,"...",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Vyrn,"Betcha weren't expecting that, huh? You can only dream of matching my pal's sword skills!",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Imperial Soldier,"Curses... This isn't over!",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Vyrn,"A friend of his? Stay sharp!",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Knight,"Lyria! Are you all right?",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Mysterious Girl,"Katalina! I... I...",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Knight,"Thank goodness she hasn't been injured. Have you two been protecting her?",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Vyrn,"I guess you could say that! They were after us too, so we just did what came naturally.",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Mysterious Girl,"You should have seen it, Katalina! This hero saved me! It was so... heroic!",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Knight,"Is that so? Well, I'm just glad you're safe.",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Vyrn,"So, um... Who are you guys exactly?",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Vyrn,"Doesn't seem like you're friends with those jerks from earlier.",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Katalina,"Ah, yes, how rude of me. My name is Katalina Aryze.",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Katalina,"And this is Lyria. I can't thank you enough for saving her.",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Katalina,"If you don't mind, could you tell me your name as well?",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Vyrn,"And I'm Vyrn! Where'd you two come from? Were those soldiers after you?",

English,scene_tutorial01,detail,???,"Lieutenant Katalina!",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,???,"I do say. Did I give the order for you to stop and smell the roses out here, Lieutenant?",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Katalina,"C-Captain Pommern! Terribly sorry, sir. I'll return Lyria to the ship immediatel—",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Pommern,"Enough of these lies! You're the one who spirited her away from the ship, are you not?",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Pommern,"I do say! To defy the mighty Erste Empire requires profound bravery... and profound <span class='scene-font-italic'>stupidity</span>.",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Katalina,"...",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Pommern,"You knew the classified nature of the girl's existence when we placed her in your protection.",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Pommern,"Which means you must surely be aware of the gravity of your actions, yes?",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Pommern,"We need that girl to command the primals. To assist in her escape demands a grave punishment indeed!",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Katalina,"Captain... I simply thought it too dangerous for us to attempt using the power of the primal beasts.",

English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Vyrn,"Excuse me?",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Pommern,"I'll rid this place of anyone who opposes us! For I do say, the power to control the primals belongs to the Empire!",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Pommern,"Release the Hydra!",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Imperial Soldier,"Sir!",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Katalina,"The Hydra? It can't be!",

English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Hydra,"Groooar!",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Vyrn,"Where'd this crazy monster come from! Did that beard-twirlin' doofus bring it with him?",

English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Katalina,"You really intend to burn this island to the ground, don't you?",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Katalina,"Is that how far the Empire's willing to go to use Lyria's power as their own?",

English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Vyrn,"Hold on... You're not actually thinking about tangling with that thing!",
English,scene_tutorial01,sel1_txt,,We have to save them!,
English,scene_tutorial01,sel2_txt,,It's now or never!,
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Pommern,"I do say! It seems none of you are willing to accept reality!",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Pommern,"Hydra! Dispose of this miserable little moppet!",
English,scene_tutorial01,detail,Pommern,"May the tot serve as a fitting example of what happens when you defy the Empire!",
